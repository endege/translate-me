I created a lightweight translation web app that works with any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenRouter, NavyAI, NanoGPT, local LLMs, etc.).
Features:
  - 🔄 Real-time streaming translations
  - 📝 Custom translation prompts (translate to any language, with any style/tone)
  - 🎨 Clean, modern UI with dark glass-morphism design
  - 🔤 Adjustable font sizes for each text box
  - ⚙️ Configurable API settings (endpoint, model, temperature)
  - 💾 Settings saved in browser (no server-side storage)
  - 🆓 100% free and open source

  Try it here: https://endege.github.io/translate-me/

You'll need your own API key from OpenRouter, OpenAI, or any compatible provider. Everything runs in your browser - no data is sent to my server since there isn't one!
Perfect for translating long texts, novels, or anything where you want more control over the translation style.
Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS - no frameworks, just a single file.

P.S. For Chinese, try the DeepSeek or Qwen models.
